# CS50 Problem Sets

This repository contains my completed problem sets from **CS50**, Harvard’s introductory course in Computer Science.

The focus of this work is on building strong foundations through hands-on implementation, not tutorials or copy-paste solutions.

## Scope

The repository includes problem sets organized by week, covering topics such as:
- C programming
- Memory management (pointers, arrays, strings)
- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
- Debugging and reasoning about program behavior
- Translating specifications into correct, efficient code

Each solution was developed independently as part of the CS50 curriculum.

## Technologies

- C
- CS50 Library
- GCC / Clang
- Command-line tools

## Notes

This repository is intended to demonstrate disciplined practice, clarity of thought, and growing technical maturity in computer science fundamentals.

It is not a showcase of finished products, but of foundational work that supports deeper software engineering and systems development.
